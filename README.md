# Streamlit_Profile_Intro

Researcher Profile and STEM Data Explorer

Introduction

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that serves as a researcher profile and STEM data explorer. The application was developed as part of my first exposure to Streamlit, thanks to the CHPC Coding Summer School. It demonstrates how to create interactive and dynamic web applications using Python and Streamlit.

Features

The application includes the following main sections:

1. Researcher Profile

Displays key information about the researcher (Leemisa Moleko), including:

Name

Field of Research

Institution (North-West University)

Role (Honours Student, Tutor, and Student Assistant)

Research Interests (Software Development, Testing, Automation, Data Science, AI, and Innovation)

Includes an image upload feature for displaying a profile picture.

2. Projects

Lists key projects with relevant technologies used, such as:

CRUD RESTful API for telemetry data (C#, .NET Core, Azure, GitHub)

Web App GUI Design (Blazor, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Power BI Reports for NWU Tech Trends (Power BI, SQL, Data Analytics)

Automated UI Tasks with UiPath (UiPath, Excel, RPA)

Data is displayed in an interactive dataframe.

3. STEM Data Explorer

Allows users to explore various STEM datasets:

Physics Experiments: Displays experiment data with energy levels.

Astronomy Observations: Displays celestial object brightness levels.

Power BI Data Analysis: Placeholder for future data analytics projects.

Includes interactive filtering options using sliders to refine data.

4. Contact Information

Displays contact details, including:

Email: leemisamoleko@gmail.com

LinkedIn Profile

GitHub Profile

Provides clickable links for easy access.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for logic and data handling.

Streamlit: Framework for creating interactive web applications.

Pandas: Used for handling tabular data.

NumPy: Used for numerical operations.

Learning Experience

This project was my first exposure to Streamlit, and I found it to be an incredibly powerful and beginner-friendly tool for building interactive web applications. Through this project, I learned how to:

Create a multi-page navigation system using Streamlit's sidebar.radio().

Integrate dynamic content and data visualization.

Implement interactive filtering options with sliders.

Display structured data in tables and dataframes.

Handle profile management and project showcasing.

Future Improvements

Add real-time data fetching from APIs.

Enhance data visualization with graphs and charts.

Implement a database backend for storing researcher profiles and projects.

Allow users to upload and analyze their own datasets.

Conclusion

This project provided me with a solid foundation in Streamlit and web-based data exploration. I am excited to continue building on this knowledge and integrating more advanced data science and machine learning capabilities in the future.
